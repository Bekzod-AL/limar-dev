Nearly 250 miles of the singletrack experiences you read in ‘zines, watch on YouTube, doom scroll for on Instagram, and simply dream about is what makes up this figure-eight loop around Truckee and Lake Tahoe. It didn’t take any convincing to go back. It’s just that good.<\/p>\n\n<p>This year saw its biggest field to date. Along with that larger field came more horsepower—a handful of riders vying for the win and possibly a new course record. My entire race was a back and forth battle with Matt Fox from the Bay Area. From about mile 10 to mile 170, we went back and forth trading the lead, dealing with biomechanicals and bike mechanicals. I haven’t had a mechanical in a bike race in a long time, but a rock or stick bouncing off my rear derailleur on the Hole in the Ground descent left me with a twisted derailleur for the rest of the event. After some bending and adjusting, I had about seven useful gears out of 12 to work with. Thankfully, they were all the easier gears. On the climb up to the high point of Freel Peak at mile 150, Matt simply rode and walked away from me.<\/p>",
