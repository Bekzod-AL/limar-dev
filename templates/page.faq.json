So first of all carefully check that the helmet has the correct label. Then make sure it fits perfectly to your head (not too tight and not too loose). This means you have to wear it properly (which is not usually possible if the helmet is blistered as it might happen when displayed in supermarkets).</p>"

Knowing whether helmets reduce the risk of head injuries by 88%, by 65% or by 50% (just to quote some data) is just important for statistics purposes and a secondary factor if we talk about prevention. The most important aspect is that helmets reduce the risk of head injuries!</p>"
